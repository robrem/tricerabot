# Tricerabot
A take on the Adafruit [Stumble Bot](https://learn.adafruit.com/stumble-bot-with-circuit-playground-and-crickit) using the [Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express) and [Crickit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-crickit-creative-robotic-interactive-construction-kit) controller boards.

## Master branch
This bot walks and roars like a dinosaur! 

Press the **A button** on the Circuit Playground Express to start.

Recommended: Hook up a speaker to hear the roar.

## IR_Remote branch
Instead of pressing the A button to start the bot, use the **Play/Pause button** on an NEC IR Remote.

This bot is stealthier (no roar).

Note: You may need to check the response code from your remote, just to be sure it matches with the expected one.
